This is my cs170 lab on the 8 Puzzle using uniform cost search, A* with mismatched with the Misplaced Tile heuristic and A* with the Manhattan Distance heuristic. It shows the traces of the 8-puzzle and how to solve it with three different algorithms.
# Introduction
The sliding tile puzzle problem is a puzzle that challenges players to slide a board piece among different routes to get to the goal state (Wikipedia). More specifically, the 8-puzzle is a 3-by-3 puzzle that has 8 square pieces on a grid with a blank or empty tile. The 8-puzzle is numbered accordingly from 1 to 8, with the last tile slot being empty (Wikipedia). There are many other variations of this puzzle with different grid sizes like the 3 puzzle (2 x 2 grid), or even the 15-puzzle (4 x 4 grid). The goal is to make a series of moves to reach the goal state of numerical order, with the blank tile being at the bottom-rightmost spot.
